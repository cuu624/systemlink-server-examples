    "This example uses the nptdms package to create a TDMS file with 10 sine waves, with noise. Each waveform contains 1000 points and has a frequency of 20 hertz. The File Service API is used to upload the resulting TDMS file, if the file is not present. The uploaded file is used by the TDMSReader example notebook.\n",
